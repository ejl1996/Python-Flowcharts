## Q1 Identify the problem here: Sorting CST students from youngest to oldest (Sort.pdf)

### Decomposition: 
1. Recognized the need for a comparison step where the students' birthday would need to be compared. 
2. If the birthdays were the same, recognized the need for a comparison step where the students' height would need to be completed. 
3. If the birthday/height of the first student was later/taller than that of the second student, the two students' position would need to be swapped. 
4. If the index value, denoting the student position, was equal to or greater than the total number of CST students, the loop would need to reset and start from the first student again. 
5. If the loop checked the birthday/height of all students and no more swaps were required, the program should end and print out the list of students in order.

### Pattern matching:
I noticed the following pattern when cycling through each iteration of the ordered_list: the students would need to be sorted by age and height (youngest to oldest, shortest to tallest). Once going through the entire list, if no more swaps were needed to be made, it would tell us that the ordered_list has been sorted from youngest to oldest and shortest to tallest (if two students' birthdays are the same).     

### Abstraction: 
In order to sort students by their birthday and height, the only information deemed necessary were the following: CST students' height and birthday.  

### Automation and algorithms:
Assembled the flowchart in the following order:
1. Compared the birthday of the students and swapped positions accordingly. 
2. If the birthday of the students were the same, compared the students' height and swapped positions accordingly. 
3. If the index value of the students is greater than or equal to the total number of students, restarted the list to the first position. 
4. If the loop checked the birthday/height of all students and no swaps were required, displayed the ordered list of students. 

## Q2 Identify the problem here: Instructing how to make congee and scrambled eggs (Breakfast.pdf)

### Decomposition: 
1. Recognized the need for a step where the user would be instructed on how to make traditional congee. 
2. The user would also need to be instructed on how to make French-style scrambled eggs. 
3. Upon serving the two meals, the user should be able to choose the pieces of Terra Olive Bread desired. 
4. The user should be able to choose the dollops of jam desired on each piece of Terra Olive Bread. 
5. If breakfast has been served with Terra Olive Bread, the program should end.

### Pattern matching:
I noticed the following pattern for each requested recipe: I would need to prepare the ingredients, provide a step-by-step instruction for each meal, and serve each prepared meal.  

### Abstraction:
In order to successfully prepare all required components of breakfast, the required information were: step-by-step instructions to prepare traditional congee and French-style scrambled eggs.  

### Automation and algorithms:
Assembled the flowchart in the following order: 
1. Instructed the user on how to make traditional congee. 
2. Instructed the user on how to make French-style scrambled eggs. 
3. After preparing the two meals, asked the user to input pieces of Terra Olive Bread desired on the side. 
4. After preparing the pieces of Terra Olive Bread, asked the user to input dollops of jam desired on each piece of Terra Olive Bread. 

## Q3 Identify the problem here: Instructing how to fold a traditional origami fox (Fox.pdf)

### Decomposition:
Broke the problem into the following components: 
1. Folding the fox's body. 
2. Folding the fox's ears.  
3. Folding the fox's face. 
4. Folding the fox's tail. 
5. Decorating the fox. 
6. Making the fox stand up. 

### Pattern matching:

### Abstraction:
In order to properly fold a traditional origami fox, the required information was: a step-by-step instruction to fold a traditional origami fox. 

### Automation and algorithms:
Assembled the flowchart in the following order: 
1. Instructed how to fold the fox's body. 
2. Instructed how to fold the fox's ears. 
3. Instructed how to fold the fox's face.
4. Instructed how to fold the fox's tail.
5. Instructed how to decorate the fox's face, ears, and tail. 
6. Instructed how to make the fox stand up by using its tail for support.
